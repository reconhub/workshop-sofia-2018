# EPIET Outbreak Investigation Module: Copenhagen

This repository contains the code and data for the Epiet Outbreak Investigation
module "Outbreak of gastroenteritis after a high school dinner in Copenhagen, Denmark,November 2006"

# Learning Goals

By the end of this module, the students should:

 - be able to neatly organise data, scripts, and reports in R
 - be able to write and render RMarkdown documents
 - be able to read in and write data in flat text files
 - be able to read help files effectively 
 - be able to perform single variable and stratified descriptive epidemiological
   analysis using 2x2 contingency tables
 - be familiar with functions, lapply, and for loops

# Instructions

1. Open the file called `copenhagen.pdf`.
2. Double-click on the `recon-day-1.Rproj` file to open RStudio
3. Open `reports/01-intro-clean.Rmd` and follow along with `copenhagen.pdf`.

The case study has been split into four sections, following the same data set.
In the RMarkdown files, there will be pre-written code for you to run. 

As you progress through the documents, you will need to add code in order to 
continue. The code in these places will have a comment that looks like this:

```
#!!! replace this line with code
```

You should follow the instructions written on that line and replace it with
valid R code. You may copy and paste from `copenhagen.pdf` if you find yourself
having trouble.
