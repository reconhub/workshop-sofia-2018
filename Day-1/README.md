# EPIET Outbreak Investigation Module: Copenhagen

This repository contains the code and data for the Epiet Outbreak Investigation
module "Outbreak of gastroenteritis after a high school dinner in Copenhagen, Denmark,November 2006"

# Learning Goals

By the end of this module, the students should:

 - be able to neatly organise data, scripts, and reports in R
 - be able to write and render RMarkdown documents
 - be able to read in and write data in flat text files
 - be able to read help files effectively 
 - be able to perform single variable and stratified descriptive epidemiological
   analysis using 2x2 contingency tables
 - be familiar with functions, lapply, and for loops

# Instructions

1. Open the first practical on RECON learn: <https://www.reconlearn.org/post/copenhagen-introduction.html>
2. Double-click on the `recon-day-1.Rproj` file to open RStudio
3. Open `reports/01-intro-clean.Rmd` and follow along with the tutorials on RECON learn.

The case study has been split into four sections, following the same data set.
In the RMarkdown files, there will be pre-written code for you to run. 

As you progress through the documents, you will need to add code in order to 
continue. The code in these places will have a comment that looks like this:

```
#!!! replace this line with code
```

You should follow the instructions written on that line and replace it with
valid R code. You may copy and paste from `copenhagen.pdf` if you find yourself
having trouble.
